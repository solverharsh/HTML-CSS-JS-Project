# **Image Hover Effect**

---

This project is to animate the images on hover.

#### **Learning from this project :**

- Clip-Path property
- The `clip-path` CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.
- Use of [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) to include the images of desired shape in _clip-path property_ to make the project awesome.
